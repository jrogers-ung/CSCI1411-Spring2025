# 1. Declare your function named "crackLogin" and will need 2 parameters.
# One parameter for the username and one for the password list.
# Keep in mind that you are building a function below.
# As you build your function, you can test it out by completing #6-8 and running the entire script.
# YOUR CODE BELOW HERE (*Note the lefthand curly brace already provided for your function)

{
    # 2. Below you will attempt each password in the pasword list for your brute force attack! 
    # Write a foreach loop method to itereate through each common password in the password file. 
    # (Hint: Check out the argument names you provided to the function, agian the first lefthand curly brace provided)
    # YOUR CODE BELOW HERE 

    {
        # 3. You will need to build an array of user credentials to attempt the hack with.
        # * Create an empty array called "payload". 
        # * Add your victim's username variable to the payload array. 
        # * Next, add one password to the payload array.
        # HINT: To add items to an payload array you can use += operator
        # Optionally, print out the payload object after its created to confirm it's values.
        # YOUR CODE BELOW HERE
 
        
        ## DO NOT MODIFY ##
        Write-Host "--------------"

        # 4. The Invoke-Expression cmdlet is used to call other powershell scripts. 
        # Below will call Login.ps1 and send the payload (username, password) to the login page.
        # The syntax is partially provided.
        # 
        # Your job is complete the line and payload array created earlier.
        # Remember <payload array variable> will need to be replaced with the variable name of the payload array.
        # YOU MUST MODIFY LINE BELOW
        Invoke-Expression  "& `".\Login.ps1`" <payload array variable>" -OutVariable out
 
        # 5. The payload has been sent to the login screen, and the result has been sent 
        # back to you as the variable $out.
        # * Write an if-statement that will let you know a match has been found. 
        # HINT: The $out varialbe will equal either "Access Denied" or "Access Granted"
        # * When access is granted, write a statement to RETURN the successful payload array
        #   and stop the loop from attempting anymore login attempts.
        # YOUR CODE BELOW HERE

#-----------------------------------------------------------[Execution]------------------------------------------------------------
# 6. You will need a variable with a list of most commonly used passwords to iterate 
# through when trying to hack the users password.
# Create a variable that stores the content from the most commonly used passwords file. 
# *Important* Use the file path .\10k-most-common-passwords.txt
# YOUR CODE BELOW HERE 


# 7. A variable is needed that stores the victim's username. 
# HINT: Look for the victim's username in the description above.
# YOUR CODE BELOW HERE


# 8. Finally, you are ready to execute your function! You must store the results of the function 
# in the variable name $result to receive full credit.
#   Example: $result = <function name> argument1 argument2
# Remember to add your two arguments after calling your function. 
# You created two variables in #1 and #2 that could be called here.
# One final hint, a password match should happen in the first 15 seconds but no longer than a minute.
# YOUR CODE BELOW HERE
